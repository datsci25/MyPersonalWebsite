# ✨ **My First GitHub Project**

Hi, this is my first Github project exploring the world of coding and open-source. I’m learning as I go 🚀

🧰 **Tools: GitHub, VSCode, HTML**

The goal is to practice coding, understand how GitHub works, and slowly build up small projects.

Features:

I would like to try some beginner-friendly code with simple layouts

I would also like to try software version control


🌱 **What I’m Learning**

How GitHub works 🧠

Writing cleaner code ✍️

Creating open-source projects

Markdown basics for README files 📄

**What’s Next**

 Add new features

 Make the design look cooler

 Learn JavaScript (or another language!)

 Collaborate with others


**Portfolio**

I will be adding my new projects here.

Thank you
